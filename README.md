# Two-dimensional exciton calculations
This collection of scripts uses Quantum Espresso(QE) to calculate the optical exciton
in two-dimensional systems, with the possibility to introduce strain and buckling.

## Requirements
  1. Working version of QE(>=6.0)
  2. Gnuplot (>=5.0)
  3. QEPPlib + c_scripts (provided in the tools directory)
